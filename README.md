Title:Hair Salon Booking App with Android Studio, Firebase, XML, and Java

In this project, I developed a mobile application using Android Studio to allow users to book hair appointments online at a salon. The app provides a seamless user experience where clients can select their preferred hairstylist, choose a service, and reserve a time slot directly from the app.

Key features of the project include:

Designing the app's user interface with XML to ensure a smooth and intuitive booking experience.
Implementing the app's logic using Java for the backend, managing the booking process and interaction with the database.
Storing user and appointment data on Firebase, providing real-time updates on booking availability and user confirmation.
Ensuring secure user authentication and management through Firebase's authentication services.
Handling real-time notifications to confirm bookings or changes in appointment schedules.
This app demonstrates a practical implementation of an Android-based booking system, combining mobile development with cloud database integration.
